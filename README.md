 <p>This particular stock management system is designed with a graphical user interface (GUI) and uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to store and manage data. The GUI provides an easy-to-use interface for users to interact with the system, allowing them to view and update information about the stock, such as its location, quantity, and status. The SQL database is used to store and organize the data, allowing for efficient retrieval and analysis of the information.<p>
